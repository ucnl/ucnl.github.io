## KEY FEATURES

* **Minimum dimensions and weight**
* **Strong and durable moulded case made of polyurethane**
* **Automatic turn-on in water**
* **Charging from USB port**

## DESCRIPTION

Navigation hydroacoustic buoy **WAYU GIB** of the system **[WAYU](WAYU_DataBrief_en.md)** as part of a set of four such devices forms a floating long navigation base, with the support of which positioning of the pinger is provided **[WAYU Pinger](WAYU_Pinger_Specification_en.md)**.
The device has a monoblock one-piece construction and is made of high-strength polyurethane, automatically turns off when it gets into the water and is charged from the USB port. Doesn't require any adjustments and calibrations.
