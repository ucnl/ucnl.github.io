## KEY FEATURES

* **Minimum dimensions and weight**
* **Strong and durable maintenance-free housing**
* **Automatic switching on from water**

## DESCRIPTION

The navigation hydroacoustic buoy **WAYU GIB** of the **[WAYU](WAYU_DataBrief_en.md)** system, as part of a set of four such devices, forms a floating long navigation base, with the support of which the positioning of the **[WAYU Pinger](WAYU_Pinger_Specification_en.md)** pinger is ensured.
The device has a non-separable design and is made of high-strength polyurethane and polypropylene, it automatically switches on when it hits the water. It does not require any settings or calibrations. Buoyancy is provided by an easily visible float made of ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA).
