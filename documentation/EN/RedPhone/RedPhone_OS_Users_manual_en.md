### 2.3. Working with the station
Before work, all preparations and checks provided in [p. 2.2] ().

The underwater telephone works in half-duplex mode: transmission and reception alternate; if the device is in transmission mode, it cannot receive incoming messages.

#### 2.3.1. Sound signals
Possible sound alerts are summarized in **table 4**.

### **Table 4** - Sound alerts

| Alert Description | What signals | Example |
| : --- | : --- | : --- |
| Short rising and then lowering tone | The station power-on and switch to receive mode | [Sound sample](/documentation/redphone_pwon.wav) |
| Short rising tone | Switching to receive mode after completion of transmission (releasing tangents **PTT**) | [Sample sound](/documentation/redphone_switch_to_rx.wav) |
| Long trill | Low charge internal power supply | |

#### 2.3.2. Receiving voice messages
To receive voice messages from divers, the **PTT** button on the microphone must be released. In this case, incoming messages will be played by the device’s speaker (or headphones, if the latter are connected and the toggle switch **“Speaker”** is in the state **“Off”**).

The volume of reproduced incoming voice messages depends on the slant range between the antenna station and the diver, as well as on hydrological conditions. It may decrease when a diver enters the acoustic shadow zone (when elements of the underwater landscape, parts of structures, ships, algae, etc. are on the signal path).

The user must independently set a comfortable volume level using the **Volume** control depending on the current communication conditions.
