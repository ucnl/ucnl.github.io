# Compatibility Requirements: <br/> Heading and Positioning Systems

## 1. General information
The [Zima USBL](Zima_DataBrief_en.md) system allows the user to revise the coordinates of responder beacons from the local polar 
coordinate system in geographic time.

For this purpose [ZHost](https://api.github.com/repos/ucnl/ZHost/zipball) software requires data on the geographical position of 
[Zima-B](Zima_B_Specification_en.md) station and its orientation relative to cardinal points.

Two options are possible:
* Data on the geographical position of the antenna and its orientation are generated using the **GNSS compass**. This option is most 
preferred;
* GNSS data on the geographical position of the antenna are generated by the **GNSS receiver**, and data on its orientation relative to the 
cardinal points - using a **magnetic compass**;

## 2. Protocol requirements
[ZHost](https://github.com/ucnl/ZHost) software can connect two additional sources of navigation data (using the serial ports **AUX1**
and **AUX2** in the **"Settings"** window).
The physical connection of devices is carried out either using physical serial ports (COM, or PC) or using the **RS-232/422/485 <-> USB**
interface converters.

[ZHost](https://api.github.com/repos/ucnl/ZHost/zipball) software supports the **NMEA0183** protocol, and in particular, the following sentences:

* **HDG** - Orientation data relative to cardinal points (**magnetic compass**)
* **HDT** - Orientation data relative to cardinal points (**GNSS compass**)
* **RMC** - Geographic Location Data (**GNSS Receiver**)

For correct operation, either a pair of **RMC + HDT** sentences (GNSS compass) or **RMC + HDG** (GNSS receiver and magnetic compass) is 
required.

If both types of angular orientation message data (**HDG** and **HDT**) appear in the software, only data from **HDT** messages will be used.


## 3. Accuracy and refresh rate requirements
The accuracy of the **GNSS receiver** should be no worse than **2.5 m (2DRMS)**, the frequency of updating the data on the geographic 
location should be at least **1 time per second**.

Recommended accuracy of orientation relative to cardinal points: **1Â° (DRMS)**, with a refresh rate of **5 Hz**.

It is possible to use navigation data with lower accuracy, but it must be borne in mind that, when calculating the absolute location of 
responders, errors of the angles of arrival estimation and errors of the antenna orientation estimation using a magnetic or GNSS compass are
summed.
