## KEY FEATURES

* **Small size and weight**
* **IP67**
* **Long-life built-in LiFePO4 power supply**
* **Ability to work from an external power source**
* **3 mm thick hight quality stainless steel faceplate**


## DESCRIPTION

The Bat & Link Box device combines the functions of an autonomous power supply for a direction-finding station [Zima-B](Zima_B_Specification_ru.md) and a converter for pairing the station with a user's PC, as well as for connecting data sources on the heading and position of the direction-finding station. Contains protection circuits against reverse polarity and overvoltage of connected devices.

The device is housed in a small shockproof plastic case. Has a front panel made of high-quality stainless steel. The modern lithium-iron-phosphate batteries used in the device provide operation at low temperatures and **more than a thousand** charge-discharge cycles. If necessary, it is possible to work from an external 12 V DC source and at the same time charge the built-in battery from a standard charger.
