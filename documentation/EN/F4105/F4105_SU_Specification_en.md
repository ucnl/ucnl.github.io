## KEY FEATURES

* 64 unique addresses for acoustic realses
* Programming the address of releases and issuing commands in one device
* Durable, long-lasting plastic housing IP67<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>
* Stainless steel control panel
* Built-in LiFePO4 battery

## DESCRIPTION

The device is designed to:
- assign addresses to acoustic release receiver units [F4105-AU](F4105_AU_Specification_en.md)
- issue a command to acoustic release receiver units [F4105-AU](F4105_AU_Specification_en.md)

The device is made in accordance with the protection class IP67<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> and can operate autonomously thanks to the built-in power source.
