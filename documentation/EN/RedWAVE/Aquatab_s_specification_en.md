## DESCRIPTION

**[RedWave](RedWAVE_DataBrief_en.md)** - is the only system to date created using patented <sup>[*](#footnote_a1)</sup> technology and implementing the so-called "underwater GPS": exactly following the ideology of GPS and other satellite systems, it allows an unlimited number of underwater objects to determine their geographical position simultaneously. The **Aquatab S** diving tablet will allow you to use the **[RedWave](RedWAVE_DataBrief_en.md)** system to the maximum, providing the same convenience for working with navigation and maps underwater as well as on land.

**[Aquatab S](https://duslate.com/products/aquatab-s/)** — it is a complete underwater tablet computer in a compact size, with a full screen for entering and displaying information, which works with a special patented stylus or a special glove pad, which allows divers to work with gloves and very accurately enter data, press small icons on the desktop, draw any diagrams or take notes.

**[Aquatab S](https://duslate.com/products/aquatab-s/)** can be based on a modified version of modern smartphones Samsung Galaxy Note 10 lite, Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra or Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra at the choice of the buyer. This solution allows you to run any application for the Android OS, and the choice of a specific smartphone model depends on the buyer's requirements for performance, memory, display resolution and camera.

One of the biggest advantages is the presence of a rear camera that provides high resolution photos and videos that can be taken underwater during dives.

**[Aquatab S](https://duslate.com/products/aquatab-s/)** is a device without buttons, which eliminates the risk of water leakage. To turn it on, you need to touch the display with the stylus, that has a built-in magnet, and a sensor installed inside the tablet activates the device. In addition, it is equipped with an additional battery and provides more than 12 hours of continuous operation, which is more than enough for underwater work.

The body of the **[Aquatab S](https://duslate.com/products/aquatab-s/)** is made of a special aluminum alloy and the display is protected by an impact-resistant glass that protects the device from accidental damage from sharp or hard objects. For additional protection of glass from scratches, it is advisable to use a special protective coating (film).

The underwater tablet **[Aquatab S](https://duslate.com/products/aquatab-s/)** allows divers to use GPS navigation and mark the exact location of objects on preloaded offline maps or the geolocation of the diver himself **underwater**. The underwater GPS navigation function works as an integral part of the system, which includes lightweight floating buoys **[RedBase](RedBASE_Specification_en.md)** and an acoustic navigation receiver **[RedNode](RedNODE_Specification_en.md)** connected to **[Aquatab S](https://duslate.com/products/aquatab-s/)**.

Features depend on features of a device used in **[Aquatab S](https://duslate.com/products/aquatab-s/)**:
* Samsung Galaxy Note 10 lite
* Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra
* Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra

The characteristics of smartphones can be found in detail on the manufacturer's website.
