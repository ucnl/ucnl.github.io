## DESCRIPTION

**[RedNWAVE](RedWAVE_DataBrief_ru.md)** - the only system to date that implements the so-called "underwater GPS": following exactly
the ideology of GPS and other satellite systems, allows an unlimited number of underwater objects to determine their geographical 
location at the same time.

**RedNAV** - the diving navigation receiver of the system [RedWAVE](RedWAVE_DataBrief_en.md), which allows the diver to determine 
his geographical position when immersed, without the need for surfacing and using remote GPS antennas on the cable.

With the support of four floating sonobuoys [RedBASE](RedBASE_Specification_en.md), it is possible in one water area
simultaneous operation of an unlimited number of devices **RedNAV** and [RedNODE](RedNODE_Specification_en.md).

Working with a navigation receiver **RedNAV** is in many ways similar to working with conventional GPS/GLONASS trackers and navigators, 
with the difference that the role of satellites is performed by four small-sized sonobuoys [RedBASE](RedBASE_Specification_en.md). 
The device is mounted on the diver’s wrist and the hydroacoustic antenna on the shoulder or tank.

The unique functionality and ease of use make **RedNAV** an ideal solution for both recreational diving and search diving.
archaeological and underwater engineering works.

Fully wireless pairing with PC via Bluetooth and wireless charging makes it extremely easy to maintain and reliable.
